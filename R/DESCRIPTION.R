#' Bring some survey analysis functions and some utils.
#'
#' Mainly a reminder of totally-perfectible functions used and made on the go
#' for the Burkina Faso mission in 2021. Some functions written as utils (to never
#' write them again) and to monitor, clean and analyze (still to be written) Kobo
#' survey data, mainly using the `srvyr` package and the tidyverse overall.
#' It requires R 4.1+ (mostly for the native pipe `|>`).
